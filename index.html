                        We appreciate that the scoring and admissions criteria for medical school is complex and 
                        it is not possible for this tool to take into account all the factors considered by universities 
                        when scoring applications. 
                        We would therefore not recommened that individuals apply solely based on the information from this tool and 
                        advise individuals to combine the information obtained from this tool with information

                        Many Universities acknowledge the challenges faced by particular groups who are typically under-represented at University or in Medicine. 
                        The qualifying criteria varies between universities and includes:
                        students who are the first in their family to consider higher enducation, attending a school with a lower progression to higher education, quailfying for free school meals or a UCAT bursary,
                        being in care, being estranged from family members, being a young carer, being a member of the travelling community.
                        <br>
                        Some universites may offer grade offers which are contexualised for students in these groups. In addition, some universities have a 'Gateway to Medicine' Course,
                        which are courses that are intended for students in this group who do not meet the academic requirements for the standard medical course. Gateway courses include an additional one-year course before progression to the standard Medical course. 
            
                        The table below details the universities that provide this option for undergraduate medicine. As the specific criteria varies across different universities, please refer to the university websites for their specific criteria.

                                    Traditional medical courses have a clear divide between 'pre-clinical' years and 'clinical' years. 
                                    In the first two 'Pre-Clincial' years, students study basic sciences often in the form of lectures and laboratory practicals. 
                                    In the latter three 'Clinical' years, students undergo placments in different healthcare settings. <br> <br>
                                    <b>PBL</b> <br>
                                    Problem Based Learning (PBL) Courses are more self-directed in nature.
                                    Learning of topics is centred around a clinical case and individuals set their own learning objectives and teach each other about different aspects of the case in facilitated sessions. 
                                    <br> Different unversities vary in how much PBL is included in the course.  <br> <br>
                                    <b>Integrated</b> <br> Integrated Courses are somewhat of an amalgamation of traditional and PBL courses. 
                                    Most courses are 'systems-based' where individuals learn each bodily system in turn, covering all the different aspects of each system.
                                    These courses may feature both lectures as well and self-directed group work.

                                    Problem Based Learning (PBL) Courses are more self-directed in nature.
                                    Learning of topics is centred around a clinical case and individuals set their own learning objectives and teach each other about different aspects of the case in facilitated sessions. 
                                    <br> Different unversities vary in how much PBL is included in the course.  <br> <br>
                                    <b>Integrated</b> <br> Integrated Courses are somewhat of an amalgamation of traditional and PBL courses. 
                                    Most courses are 'systems-based' where individuals learn each bodily system in turn, covering all the different aspects of each system.
                                    These courses may feature both lectures as well and self-directed group work.  </span>
